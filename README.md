# Example App of Google Auth Signin using React Native and Firebase

- Generate a fresh React Native app (I use a Typescript template, you can use any template or no template at all),
I highly recommand to choose a random app name for a reason I will explain in a later step:

```bash
npx react-native init App_972035 --template react-native-template-typescript
```
